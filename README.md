# JS-Question-3-longest-sequence
(Without using any JS method)

Find the longest sequence in sorted array
given an array of integer numbers, sorted in ascending order, code a function that will find the
starting position of the number with the most repetitions.

i.e for the given array:
array = [1,3,5,5,5,6,9,11,11,11,11,11,13,13,13,17,17]
11 is repeated 5 times and it appears starting at index 7.

const array = [1,3,5,5,5,6,9,11,11,11,11,11,13,13,13,17,17].
console.log(max_sequence(array)); // Prints 7
